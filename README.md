## Features 

The features for this website were chosen to prioritise ease of use and clarity to the user, ensuring information is presented in a concise and accessable manner to the end user. 

### Navigation Menu 

The website features a responsive fixed navigation bar for easy access to the various sections of the website. These include Home, About, Services/Prices and Contact. 
- The Logo, which I designed myself, is located on the far left of the navbar with the navicons placed in the middle of the screen on larger devices. 
- On smaller screensizes, a dropdown menu is used to save screen space and create simple navigation

### Hero Section

A hero section has been included with the intent of introducing the brand immediately. It shows the business' name followed by a slogan. It also includes a 'Book Now' button to clearly display one of the key functions of the website but also to allow regular customers easy access to the booking form thus saving time.

### About Section
The about section allows visitors to learn about the business by giving a brief overview of the skills and services provided.
- The section is split into two sub-sections, the first having a brief text description and the second having a carousel of dog grooming related images.
- It is hoped this section provides a stylish, boutique feel which is inline with the business' philosophy
- This section is also fully responsive. On larger screens both sub-sections appear side by side where as on smaller devices they're stacked
- The carousel has auto-slides as well as manual buttons to view the selection of images
